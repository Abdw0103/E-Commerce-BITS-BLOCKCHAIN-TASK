# BITS Blockchain Development Task 1 - Frontend

**You have to create the frontend for a basic e-commerce website. The deadline for the task is 2nd February EOD.**

*`Note: You do not need to create the smart contract, or any backend.... Yet`*

This task deals with the basics of frontend layout and javascript.

- The requirements for this task is to create a layout that can show items available for purchase.
- A connect button to connect an ethereum wallet to the website. The functionality need not be implemented for this task.
- Each item should open a modal or another web page showing the details of the page, an image of the product and allowing the user to purchase the item. Again, the buy functionality need not be implemented.
- They layout and aesthetic of the website is entirely up to you.

### Brownie Points

Note that anything done extra than what is required might fetch you some extra points. Some ideas might be:

- Allow user to search for the items.
- Provide categories for different items.
- Provide filtering functionality for the products based on other metric.

Other than these, some non-specific ideas might be to add a loader or hamburger menu on your website.
